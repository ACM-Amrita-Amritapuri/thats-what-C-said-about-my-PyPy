# In this example program we will see how decorators work in Python

# Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions. By definition, 
# a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the
# latter function without explicitly modifying it. Sounds confusing â€“ but it's really not,
# especially after we go over a number of examples.

def decorator(myFunc):
    def insideDecorator(*args):
        print('insideDecorator Function executed before {}'.format(myFunc.__name__))
        return myFunc(*args)
    return insideDecorator

@decorator      # Decorator function that takes below function as an argument
def display(*args):
    '''  This function is passed as an argument to the decorator function specified above after @ sign '''
    print('In display function')
    print(*args)

display('Hello','Hi',123)
