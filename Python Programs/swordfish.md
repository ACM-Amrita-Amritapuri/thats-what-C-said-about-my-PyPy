## Roadmap

- If the user enters any name besides the given name, the continue statement causes the program execution to jump back to the start of the loop. 
- When the program reevaluates the condition, the execution will always enter the loop, since the condition is simply the value True ! 
- Once the user makes it past that if statement, they are asked for a password .
- If the password entered is swordfish, then the break statement is run & the execution jumps out of the while loop to print Access granted. 
- Otherwise, the execution continues to the end of the while loop, where it then jumps back to the start of the loop.
- A flow chart is created to make it simpler to understand .
